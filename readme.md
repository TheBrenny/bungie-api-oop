# Bungie API OOP

This is still a work in progress, and a lot of work needs to be done. Feel free to help and contribute!

The basic premise is that this is a wrapper for [`bungie-api-ts`](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/bungie-api-ts) which is managed by the DestinyItemManager team.

The API will have ways to create something from nothing, but also ways to get inter-related data and content.

We also need a way to deal with the manifest. ðŸ™ƒ
